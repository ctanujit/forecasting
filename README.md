**Forecasting and its Applications using Python**

This is a repository where I will post my course material on Forecasting and its application taught at various universities. 

**XIM University (June, 2024)**

I taught "Business_Forecasting_Foundation_Course" and a practical session on "Business_Forecasting_Foundation.ipynb," along with the datasets used (to be found in the Code Folder).

I will keep updating this rep with more material.
